Hello, I’m @AdamJablonka
I’m interested in game development and design. In depth mechanical combat and responsive movement is what I would like to build worlds upon.
I’m currently learning Data Structures, C#, JavaScript...

I would like to learn physics based 3D combat, 3D Modelling and implimentation, coding graphical (Volumetric Ligthing, Particles, Computer shaders) changes 
with C# in the Unity engine.
