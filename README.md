# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m interested in web development/software engineering. 

I believe an intuitive and interactive webpage is a positive experience for everyone.

Currently, I'm an amateur React developer thats working towards a Bachelors in Computer Science.

Working on learning Express JS, Redux, Common Lisp, and MySQL/SQL. I am always working on honing my skills in JavaScript, and am trying to learn and understand the backend.
