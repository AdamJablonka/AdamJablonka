Hello, I’m @AdamJablonka

I’m interested in web development/engineering. An intuitive and interactive webpage is a positive experience for everyone.

Currently, I am an amateur React developer thats working towards a Bachelors in Computer Science.

Working on learning Express JS, Redux, Common Lisp, and SQL. I am always working on honing my skills in JavaScript, and trying to improve my Python.
